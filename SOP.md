## 2. View Pricing (Tab 1)

This is your default view after signing in. Use it to quickly look up Spotlight rates for client conversations.

### What you'll see
- **Product Type** — Toggle between **Add-On Spotlight** and **Standalone Spotlight**.
- **Term Length** — Choose from 6, 9, or 12 month terms.
- **Number of Placements** — Enter how many placements the client needs.
- **Price / Placement** — The monthly rate per placement at the standard ratecard price.
- **Total Monthly Cost** — Price per placement multiplied by the number of placements.
- **Ratecard Table** — A reference table showing the standard rate for each term length.

### How to use it
1. Select the **Product Type** the client is interested in.
2. Choose the **Term Length** you're discussing.
3. Enter the **Number of Placements**.
4. The pricing cards and ratecard table update automatically — use these numbers in your client conversations.

> **Note:** The price per placement is the same regardless of how many placements you enter. Volume discounts are handled through the exception request process if applicable.

## 3. Request Approval — Submitting a Pricing Exception (Tab 2)

If a client needs pricing below the standard ratecard, you can submit a pricing exception request for your manager to review.

### When to submit an exception
- The client is asking for a lower price than the ratecard.
- You have a strong business case for a discount (e.g., long-term partnership, competitive pressure, large opportunity).

### How to submit

1. Click the **Request Approval** tab.
2. Fill in the exception request form:

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Client Name** | The client or account name (e.g., "Acme Realty") |
| **Salesforce Account Link** | Paste the Salesforce URL for this account |
| **Approver** | Auto-filled with your manager's email (not editable) |
| **Product** | Add-On Spotlight or Standalone Spotlight |
| **Term Length** | 6, 9, or 12 months |
| **Number of Placements** | How many placements the client wants |
| **Requested Price / Placement** | The price you're proposing (leave blank to use the ratecard price) |
| **Business Case** | Explain *why* this exception should be approved — be specific |

3. Review the **Deal Summary** below the form. It shows all the deal details and totals so you can double-check before submitting.

4. Click **Submit Exception Request**.

### After submitting

You'll see a confirmation screen with:
- A success message confirming your request has been sent to your manager.
- An expected turnaround of **1 business day**.
- A pre-formatted **Slack message** to send to your manager.

**Important:** Click **Copy Slack Message** and paste it to your manager on Slack so they know to review your request promptly.

Click **Dismiss** to close the confirmation and submit another request if needed.

## 5. Tips for Getting Exceptions Approved

- **Be specific in your Business Case.** "Need a discount" is not enough. Explain the competitive situation, the client's potential, or the strategic value of the deal.
- **Use realistic pricing.** Requesting a price significantly below ratecard without strong justification will likely be declined.
- **Slack your manager.** Always send the Slack message after submitting — it ensures your request gets reviewed quickly.
- **Check your status.** Come back to the tool to check whether your request was approved, declined, or countered.
- **If countered**, review the counter offer details in your submitted requests table and discuss next steps with your manager.
